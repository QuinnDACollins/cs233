// Matrix-Vector multiplication
// mat is a SIZE by SIZE matrix, that is arranged in row-column, format,
// That is, you first select a particular row, and then a particular column.
// Each row is laid out as a one-dimensional, array, so if you wanted
// to select a particular row, you would use mat[row].  You can
// also select smaller intervals, by using &mat[row][col].
// The vector is also laid out as a one-dimensional arrow, similar to a row.
// M-V multiplication proceeds by taking the dot product of a matrix row
// with the vector, and doing this for each row in the matrix

// vectorize the below code using SIMD intrinsics
